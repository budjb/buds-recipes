      - Add the garlic powder, comino, chili powder, salt, and pepper to the pan, and mix the contents
        together so that everything is incorporated.
      - 'TODO: do we need to heat this before adding starch?'
      - Add the corn starch to ¼ cup of water and stir until all of the corn starch has dissolved.
        Add the corn starch slurry into the pan and stir slowly until the sauce thickens.
      - Simmer the sauce for 10 to 15 minutes.
