  I am not a big fan of overly saucy spaghetti, nor am I fan of canned sauces since they're
  all usually sweetened. I think spaghetti should be more balanced, where the sauce adds
  to the pasta on the plate (along with whatever else was added to the dish).

  The best plate of spaghetti I've ever eaten was from a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in MGM.
  I think it strikes a great balance in the ratio of noodle to sauce, and it's not overly
  sweet. I am nowhere close to being able to replicate that plate, but I did find something
  that works pretty well at home.

  I adapted this recipe from the [NYT Cooking - Classic Marinara Sauce](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015987-classic-marinara-sauce) recipe.

  * I like to serve this with Italian-style meatballs.
  * Don't drown your spaghetti with sauce with this recipe. Instead, combine the pasta and sauce
    in a large bowl, and serve once it's well mixed.
