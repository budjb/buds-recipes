  - title: Preparation
    instructions:
      - In a large mixing bowl, mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter until
        well mixed with no clumps.
      - Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until the the dough falls off of a spoon in ribbons.
      - Using a sifter, add the flour and baking soda. Fold the flour into the mixture just enough
        so that the flour is well-incorporated. Overmixing will result in cookies with a cake-like
        texture.
      - Fold in the chocolate chips.
      - Cover and chill the dough for a least an hour. Chill overnight for a more complex flavor.
  - title: Baking
    instructions:
      - Preheat the oven to 350°F.
      - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
      - Use a scooper or hand-form dough balls onto the baking sheet. Be sure to space the dough
        balls out so that they have room to spread as they cook. If hand-forming, aim for a diameter
        of around 1½ inches.
      - Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges just start to brown.
      - Remove from the oven, allow to rest for several minutes, and then move the cookies to
        cool on a cooling rack.
      - Enjoy with a glass of cold milk!
tips: |+
  If you want your cookies to remain soft, be sure to pull the cookies out _as soon_ as they
  start to brown on the edges. The cookies may look as if they are still raw and not golden-brown.
  However, the cookies will continue to cook for a few minutes after they are pulled out of the oven.
  Trust the process!
