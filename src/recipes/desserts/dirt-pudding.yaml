instructionSections:
  - name: Preparation
    instructions:
      - Allow the butter and cream cheese to warm up to room temperature.
      - In a blender or food processor, crush the whole package of Oreo cookies. Try to crush the
        Oreos so that you end up with both crumbles and chunks.
  - name: Pudding Mixture
    instructions:
      - In a large bowl, combine the butter and cream cheese together with a mixer. Mix until the
        the butter and cream cheese are well blended and mostly smooth. The cream cheese may not
        completely blend, depending on its temperature.
      - Add the powdered sugar, instant pudding, and milk to the butter and cream cheese mixture.
        Slowly mix with gradually increasing speed until the mixture has thickened.
      - Fold the cool whip into the pudding mixture. It is important to not mix the cool whip into
        the pudding so that the texture remains light and airy.

    instructions:
      - Line the bottom of a large bowl with a layer of the crushed Oreo cookies.
      - Add a layer of the pudding mixture on top of the Oreo cookie layer. This layer should be
        much thicker than the layer of crushed Oreos.
      - Keep adding alternating layers of crushed Oreo cookies and the pudding mixture.
      - The remaining Oreo cookies should be used to create the final layer of the pudding. This
        final layer is a great place to use any of the large Oreo chunks for better presentation.
      - Refridgerate the completed dirt pudding for at least 4 hours to allow the pudding to achieve
        an airy texture.
      - Serve in ice cream dishes (or plastic cups) and enjoy!
