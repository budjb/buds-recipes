  I frequently get asked how I season my beef BBQ and I always joke that the rub
  is a secret. I find it humorous since the rub is incredibly simple, and yet effective.

  This is the rub that [Aaron Franklin](https://franklinbbq.com) uses on his briskets, and
  it involves only two ingredients: salt and pepper!

  To build a good bark and texture on beef, it's helpful to use a coarse rub or seasoning.
  This is especially important when making slow-cook BBQ, such as brisket or beef
  ribs. For best results, be sure to use Kosher salt (which is a pretty coarse-ground
  salt) and 16-mesh black pepper (if you can't find it, Sam's and Costco sell "coarse
  ground pepper").

  This rub is obviously great on beef BBQ, but it also works really well on steaks!

  - instructions:
      - Measure equal parts salt and pepper, depending on the size of the container
        you will be storing the rub in. The ratio is 1-to-1, so the amount you measure
        doesn't matter as long as you end up with the same amount of salt and pepper
        in the container.
      - Mix the spice mixture well, and store.
