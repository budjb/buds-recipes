ingredientSections:
  - ingredients:
      - 1 cup long-grain rice
      - 12 fl oz chicken broth
      - 4 fl oz water
      - 1 chicken/tomato bouillon cube
      - 1 tsp garlic powder
      - 1 tsp onion powder
      - 2 tbsp cooking oil
      - Â¼ cup vegetables or peppers (optional)
instructionSections:
  - instructions:
      - Mix the chicken broth, water, onion powder, garlic powder, and crushed buillon
        cube together in a container large enough to hold the mixture (such as a measuring
        cup). Set aside.
      - Add the oil to the uncovered pan over medium heat. Let the oil heat up a bit.
      - Add the rice to the pan and combine it with the oil so that it is well-coated
        and spread out in the pan. Fry the rice until it starts to brown, stirring occassionally.
      - Once the rice has started to brown, add the liquid mixture to the pan and
        mix well. Be sure to crush any chunks of the buillon cube that remain.
      - Optionally, add any vegetables or peppers to the mix.
      - Keeping the pan at low/medium heat, allow the rice to come to a boil. Once
        the liquid is boiling, cover the pan with a glass lid. As the rice cooks, you
        should be able to see the liquid slowly dissapear beneath the rice. Do not stir
        or uncover the rice as it is cooking.
      - Once the liquid in the pan has boiled down and can no longer be seen, turn
        the burner off and let the rice rest, still covered, for 5 minutes.
tips: |+
  * The general rule of thumb for rice is that you cook it with a 1-to-2 ratio. That means
    that 1 cup of rice needs 2 cups of liquid to cook properly.
  * If you want a more tomato-y flavor, you can substitute the 4 fl oz of water out for
    a 4 oz can of tomato sauce.
  * This rice recipe does not need anything other than the rice and its seasonings, but
    you can easily add other veggies to this (as long as you don't add too much!).
    Corn, cubed carrots, peas, small tomato cubes, and chiles make great additions.
