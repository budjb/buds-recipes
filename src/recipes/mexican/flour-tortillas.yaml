ingredientSections:
  - ingredients:
      - 2 cups all-purpose flour
      - 1 tsp salt
      - ½ tsp baking powder
      - 2½ tbsp manteca (lard)
      - ¾ cup warm/hot water
instructionSections:
  - name: Preparing the Dough
    instructions:
      - Combine the flour, salt, and baking powder in a mixing bowl.
      - Add the manteca to the mixing bowl. Using your hands, work the flour mixture
        into the manteca until is well-incorporated and the mixture has a crumbly texture.
      - Add the water to the bowl. Work the water into the mixture to form a dough ball.
        Finish by kneading the dough ball for a minute to help combine any remaining crumbles.
      - Break small chunks of the dough from the dough ball and fold them into discs. You can
        experiment with how large the chunks are. The larger the chunk, the larger the tortilla.
      - Cover the dough chunks and let them rest for 15 minutes.
  - name: Rolling and Heating
    instructions:
      - Heat a comal with medium-high heat.
      - Dust your working surface with a light layer of flour.
      - Using a rolling pin with a dusting of flour, roll a dough chunk into a flat circle.
        It should be rolled to a thickness of around ¹⁄₁₆ in.
      - Transfer the raw tortilla to the comal and let sit until the top of the dough forms
        bubbles. Flip the tortilla over and let the other side cook until it is no longer
        raw and has good color.
      - Keep the finished tortillas warm inside a folded towel or tortilla warmer.
tips: |+
  * A comal is a traditional, flat pan used to heat tortillas. Any flat pan will do, however,
    cast iron is ideal becuase it will give the tortilla a good sear.
  * Dark spots from cooking the tortilla have a lot of flavor! It doesn't mean it's burnt
    (but definitely do not burn your tortillas).
  * You can substitute the manteca for other types of fat, such as oil or butter.
  * You can cheat the rolling process by using a tortilla press.
  * Eating a warm tortilla with butter is glutonous and you haven't lived until you've had one.
