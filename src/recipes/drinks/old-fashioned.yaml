  The old fashioned has turned into my favorite way to drink whiskey. This recipe is how I make mine. It's not the
  classic method that uses a fresh orange peel or zest and a sugar cube, but it instead focuses on using easily-poured
  ingredients with no mess and no waste.

  This is a whiskey drink, so use your favorite whiskey! This is incredibly subjective, but bourbon works very well
  with this drink. I'll typically use one of the following in mine:

  * Rebecca Creek
  * Maker's Mark
  * Angel's Envy

  Whatever you do, don't drink battery terminal cleaner. Life's too short for cheap alcohol! And be sure not to skimp
  on the cherries or the ice. Regular maraschino cherries don't come close to the Luxardos, and a single, large ice
  cube won't water down your drink.
