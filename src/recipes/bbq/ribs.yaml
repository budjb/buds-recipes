  Ribs are an all-time favorite BBQ dish for a lot of people, and thankfully they're really easy to make!
  As long as you have the right equipment anyway. Ribs are best cooked low and slow with non-direct heat
  and with smoke. Ideal smokers include offset smokers, eggs, and pellet smokers.

  This recipe uses the common 3-2-1 method, which breaks the process into 3 steps.

  - Step 1 runs for 3 hours and imparts a smokey flavor on the meat.
  - Step 2 runs for 2 hours and accelerates the cooking process of the ribs by braising the meat.
  - Step 3 runs for 1 hour and both finishes the meat and allows the sauce on the ribs to become sticky.

  - title: Preparation
    instructions:
      - Pre-heat your smoker to 250 degrees using your favorite mild-flavored wood. Hardwoods mixed with
        a small degree of flavor woods are a safe bet, and many popular pellet blends are perfect for ribs.
      - Ribs have a layer of connective tissue on the non-meat side called the silver skin which becomes
        chewy when cooked. For the best result, trim or peel the silver skin off.
      - Apply your favorite pork seasoning rub liberally to all sides of the meat.
      - Create a mix of 1 part apple cider to 1 part water and store in a food-safe spray bottle.
  - title: Smoking
    instructions:
      - When the smoker is up to temperature, place the ribs directly on the grates in the smoker.
      - At around 1Â½ hours into the cook, spray the top of the ribs with the watered-down apple cider mix.
  - title: Braising
    instructions:
      - After the ribs have been smoking for 3 hours, remove them from the smoker.
      - Apply a healthy amount of BBQ sauce to all sides of the ribs.
      - Wrap the ribs completely with foil with the meat side facing down.
      - Place the ribs back onto the smoker for another 2 hours.
  - title: Finishing
    instructions:
      - After the ribs have been braising for 2 hours, remove them from the smoker.
      - Lower the smoker's temporature to 225 degrees.
      - Remove the ribs from the foil and discard the foil and juices.
      - Apply another layer of BBQ sauce to the ribs.
      - Place the ribs back onto the smoker for another hour.
  - title: Serving
    instructions:
      - After the ribs have finished cooking, pull them from the smoker and allow them to rest for 10 to
        15 minutes to allow the juices to lock into the meat.
      - Slice the ribs between the joints and serve!
