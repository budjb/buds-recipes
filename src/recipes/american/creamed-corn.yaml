tips: |+
  * While we usually don't add salt, you can definitely add some if you feel it needs it.
  * Ultimately, all that's required to make this dish is that all of the ingredients are
    melted and mixed well. To speed this up, you can set the crock-pot on a higher heat
    setting, or even _microwave_ everything until it's done.
  * A slow heat and cook allows the corn to get a bit more tender and absorb more of the
    flavors of the rest of the ingredients.
  * You can try a mix of yellow and white frozen corn for a difference in texture.
